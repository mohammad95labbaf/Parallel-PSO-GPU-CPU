        "\n",
        "### **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) - GPU Implementation**\n",
        "\n",
        "This function provides a **GPU-accelerated version** of the **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** algorithm using **CuPy**. PSO is a population-based optimization algorithm that simulates the social behavior of birds or fish to find the optimal solution for a given objective function.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Function Overview:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def pso_gpu(func, lb, ub, args=(), kwargs={},\n",
        "            swarmsize=10000, omega=0.5, phip=0.5, phig=0.5, maxiter=100,\n",
        "            particle_output=False):\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`func`**: The objective function to be optimized. It accepts a position vector `x` and returns a scalar fitness value.\n",
        "- **`lb`** and **`ub`**: Lower and upper bounds for each dimension of the particles' positions.\n",
        "- **`args`** and **`kwargs`**: Additional arguments and keyword arguments to pass to the objective function `func`.\n",
        "- **`swarmsize`**: Number of particles in the swarm (default is 10,000).\n",
        "- **`omega`**: Inertia weight, influencing the particle's previous velocity (default is 0.5).\n",
        "- **`phip`**: Cognitive coefficient, influencing the attraction of particles to their personal best (default is 0.5).\n",
        "- **`phig`**: Social coefficient, influencing the attraction to the global best position (default is 0.5).\n",
        "- **`maxiter`**: Maximum number of iterations (default is 100).\n",
        "- **`particle_output`**: If `True`, returns the final positions and fitness of all particles in addition to the global best solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Algorithm Workflow:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initialization**:\n",
        "   - The positions (`x`) and velocities (`v`) of all particles are initialized randomly within the bounds `lb` and `ub` using CuPy arrays to leverage GPU parallelism.\n",
        "   - The fitness of all particles is evaluated simultaneously using the objective function `func`.\n",
        "   - Each particle's personal best position (`p`) is initialized as its current position.\n",
        "   - The global best position (`g`) is initialized as the position with the best fitness in the swarm.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Optimization Loop** (for `maxiter` iterations):\n",
        "   - **Random Numbers Pre-generation**: All random numbers for the iterations are generated in advance, stored in arrays, and used throughout the optimization to avoid repeated random number generation.\n",
        "   - **Velocity and Position Update**: The velocity and position of each particle are updated in a fully vectorized manner, taking into account its previous velocity, its personal best, and the global best.\n",
        "   - **Fitness Calculation**: The fitness of all particles is recalculated in parallel.\n",
        "   - **Personal Best Update**: If any particle's fitness improves, its personal best position is updated.\n",
        "   - **Global Best Update**: The global best position is updated if any particle’s fitness improves the current global best.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Output**:\n",
        "   - The function prints the best fitness found so far in each iteration.\n",
        "   - After all iterations, the global best position and its fitness value are returned. If `particle_output` is `True`, the function also returns the final positions and fitness values of all particles.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **GPU to CPU Transfer**:\n",
        "   - Before returning the results, the best solution is transferred back to the CPU using CuPy's `asnumpy()` function.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Key Features**:\n",
        "- **Fully Parallelized**: All particles’ positions, velocities, and fitness values are calculated in parallel using GPU acceleration, making this implementation much faster than the CPU version, especially for large swarm sizes.\n",
        "- **Vectorized Operations**: The velocity and position updates, as well as the fitness evaluations, are fully vectorized to take advantage of GPU's parallel processing capabilities.\n",
        "- **Pre-generated Random Numbers**: To improve efficiency, all random numbers for velocity updates and fitness evaluations are generated upfront for all iterations.\n",
        "  \n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Use Cases**:\n",
        "- This GPU implementation of PSO is well-suited for large-scale optimization tasks, such as optimizing complex functions with many dimensions or using large particle swarms.\n",
        "- It can be applied to problems in various domains, including engineering, machine learning (e.g., hyperparameter optimization), and finance.\n",
